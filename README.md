# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data for selected countries (Kenya, United States, and India) to uncover trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccination progress.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using the owid-covid-data.csv from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/data-on-covid19-coronavirus)

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations for cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Key insights and findings

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- Line charts for total and new cases over time
- Bar charts comparing average total cases by country
- Pie charts showing vaccination coverage
- Highlighted anomalies and trends

## 🔍 Insights

- The United States had the fastest and most widespread vaccine rollout.
- India experienced a major spike in mid-2021 due to the Delta variant.
- Kenya’s vaccination progress was slower, with higher observed fatality rates.
